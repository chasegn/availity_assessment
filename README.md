Coding exercise: Availity receives enrollment files from various benefits management
and enrollment solutions (I.e. HR platforms, payroll platforms).  Most of these files are
typically in EDI format.  However, there are some files in CSV format.  For the files in CSV
format, write a program that will read the content of the file and separate enrollees by
insurance company in its own file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and
first name (ascending).  Lastly, if there are duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance
Company, then only the record with the highest version should be included. The
following data points are included in the file:
- User Id (string)
- First Name (string)
- Last Name (string)
- Version (integer)
- Insurance Company (string)
